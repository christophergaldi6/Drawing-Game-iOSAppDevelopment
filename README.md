Issues: 

Save button has no functionality due to us not being able to figure out what is the proper way to save the image. We debated on using [Lines], an array of objects, or an array of images. 
Our favorite buttons has limited functionality. We couldn't figure out how to recall the color that we had saved from UserDefaults to use to color the Sketching tool and it won't load to the favorites screen.
